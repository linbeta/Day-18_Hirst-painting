# Day-18_Hirst-painting

The Day 18 project in [100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2021](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) (by Dr. Angela Yu)

I made some tiny changes to create a bigger picture with bigger dots.

This program would print out a rectangle of 13 x 22 random-color-dots images:

It's fun learning not only python coding, but also some interesting things about contemporary art! 

This whole project is based on a (series of) painting created by [Damien Hirst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damien_Hirst), a British Artist. The idea and the colors useed in this project is based on this piece: [Damien Hirst
Antipyrylazo III](https://www.phillips.com/detail/damien-hirst/UK010120/16)
